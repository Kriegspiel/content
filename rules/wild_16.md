The computer referee makes the following announcements where appropriate:

- "White's move" 
- "Black's move" 
- "Pawn at "square" captured" 
- "Piece at "square" captured" 
- "Rank check" 
- "File check" 
- "Long-diagonal check" (the longer diagonal from the king's point of view) 
- "Short-diagonal check" (e.g. for a king on e1, the short diagonal is e1 to h4) 
- "Knight check" 
- "*%number%* pawn tries" (number of legal capturing moves using pawns)

When you try an illegal move, you are simply told "Illegal move", whether it is
moving into check or moving through an enemy piece. Your opponent is not told
anything when you try an illegal move.
